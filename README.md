# Rapidshare::Ext

Makes your interactions with the Rapidshare API more pleasant by providing new handy features: creating/moving/deleting files/folders in a user friendly way, upload files, etc.

This gem extends the existing one - https://github.com/defkode/rapidshare, so it has all features have been implemented by the authors of the original gem at the moment.

## Installation

Add this line to your Gemfile:

    gem 'rapidshare-ext'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rapidshare-ext

## Usage

First, create an instance:
```ruby
api = Rapidshare::API.new(:login => 'my_login', :password => 'my_password')
api = Rapidshare::API.new(:cookie => 'cookie_here') # More preferable way
```

### Files

Now you can perform file download in two ways: by the HTTP url or by the absolute path.

First, by the HTTP url, as it worked before:
```ruby
@rs.download "https://rapidshare.com/files/4226120320/upload_file_1.txt",
  :downloads_dir => "/tmp",
  :save_as => "file2.txt" # This doesn't work in the base rapidshare gem

  # With a default local file name
  @rs.download "https://rapidshare.com/files/4226120320/upload_file_1.txt",
    :downloads_dir => "/tmp"
```

Download by the absolute path:
```ruby
@rs.download "/foo/bar/baz/upload_file_1.txt",
  :downloads_dir => "/tmp"
```

In both the first and second samples the result will be the same.

File uploading became very simple now:
```ruby
api.upload("/home/odiszapc/my_damn_cat.mov", :to => "/gallery/video", :as => "cat1.mov")
# => {
#  :id         => 1,
#  :size       => 12345, # File size in bytes
#  :checksum   => <MD5>,
#  :url        => <DOWNLOAD_URL>, # https://rapidshare/.......
#  :already_exists? => true/false # Does the file already exists within a specific folder, real uploading will not being performed in this case
#}
```
Destination folder will be created automatically.
After the uploading has been completed the file will be stored in a Rapidshare as "/gallery/video/cat1.mov"
You can easily get a download url after uploading:
```ruby
result = api.upload("/home/odiszapc/my_damn_cat.mov", :to => "/gallery/video", :as => "cat1.mov")
result[:url]
```

By default, file is uploaded to the root folder:
```ruby
api.upload("/home/odiszapc/my_damn_humster.mov")
```

Deleting files:
```ruby
api.remove_file("/putin/is/a/good/reason/to/live/abroad/ticket_to_Nicaragua.jpg")
```

Renaming files:
```ruby
api.rename_file("/foo/bar.rar", "baz.rar")
```

Moving files:
```ruby
api.move_file("/foo/bar/baz.rar", :to => "/foo") # new file path: "/foo/baz.rar"
api.move_file("/foo/bar/baz.rar") # move to a root folder
```

Get the file ID:
```ruby
api.file_id("/foo/bar/baz.rar") # => <ID>
```

### Folders
As you note you can have a hierarchy of folders in your account.

Creating folders:
```ruby
folder_id = api.add_folder "a/b/c" # => <FOLDER ID>
```

Deleting folders:
```ruby
api.remove_folder("/a/b/c")
```

Moving folders:
```ruby
api.move_folder("/a/b/c", :to => "/a")
```
This moves folder "c" from directory "/a/b/" and places it under the directory "/a"

Get the hierarchy of all folders in account:
```ruby
api.folders_hierarchy
# => {
#   <folder ID> => {
#     :parent => <parent folder ID>,
#     :name => <folder name>,
#     :path => <folder absolute path>
#   },
#   ...
# }
```

Note, that after the folder hierarchy is generated first time it's cached permanently to improve performance.

So, if you want to invalidate the cache just call the above method with trailing "!":
```ruby
api.folders_hierarchy!
```

If folder tree is inconsistent (orphans are found, see next paragraph for details) the Exception will be thrown when you perform #folders_hierarchy.
To automatically normalize the tree, call the method with the :consistent flag:
```ruby
api.folders_hierarchy :consistent => true
```
Be careful with the tree consistency, orphan folders may contain a critical data.

A more secure way to deal with folder consistency is to fix all orphans first and then generate folder tree:
```ruby
api.add_folder "/garbage"
api.move_orphans :to => "/garbage" # Collect all orphans and place them under the /garbage folder
tree = api.folders_hierarchy
```

Get the folder ID or path:
```ruby
id = api.folder_id("/foo/bar") # <ID>
api.folder_path(id) # "/foo/bar"
```

### Orphans
As mentioned earlier, the Rapidshare has its common problem: orphan folders.
What does it mean? When you delete parent folder by its ID the folder will be deleted without any of its child folders being deleted.
For example, let we have the basic directory tree:
```
ROOT
`-a  <- RS API allows us to delete JUST THIS folder, so hierarchy relation between folders will be lost and the folders "c" and "b" will become orphans
  `-b
    `-c
```

My know-how: orphan folders become invisible in your File Manager on the Rapidshare web site, so you may want to hide all the data in this way (stupid idea)

So, the best way to delete some directory tree without washing away its consistency is the following:
```ruby
api.remove_folder "/a" # This will correctly delete all child directories
```

But if you already have orphans in your account there is possible to fix them.
The next method detects all orphan folders in your account and moves them into a specific folder:
```ruby
move_orphans :to => "/"
```

Or we can just delete all of them (be careful):
```ruby
remove_orphans!
```

### Account
You can null your account by deleting all data stored inside. Be careful with it, because all you lose all your data:
```ruby
api.erase_all_data!
```
