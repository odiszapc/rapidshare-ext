    # Note from odiszapc:
    #
    # 1 oct 2012 the Rapidshare download API (http://images.rapidshare.com/apidoc.txt) was changed
    # so the base download function provided by rapidshare gem became broken
    #
    # In the original method the parameter :filename being interpreted incorrectly now.
    # It's being interpreted like a 'save file as' parameter. Actually it must be equal to the file name you want to download
    # So, to download file now you must specify exactly two parameters: file id and file name.
    class Download < Rapidshare::Download

      # Options:
      # * *filename* (optional) - specifies filename under which the file will be
      #   saved. Default: filename parsed from Rapidshare link.
      # * *downloads_dir* (optional) - specifies directory into which downloaded files
      #   will be saved. Default: current directory.
      #
      def initialize(url, api, options = {})

        @local_filename = options[:save_as]
        @filename = nil # It will be filled automatically by the #check method of the base class
      end

      # Checks if file exists (using checkfiles service) and gets data necessary for download.
      #
      # Returns true or false, which determines whether the file can be downloaded.
